# Data curation for ClearlyDefined
## Hi, we’re ClearlyDefined.
We are on a mission to help FOSS projects be more successful through clearly defined project data. 70% of GitHub projects do not have clear licensing. 40% of container images unknowingly contain vulnerable packages. These ambiguities mean that FOSS cannot be consumed with confidence. This affects the success of FOSS projects. A vicious cycle.

To help fix this, we are building a system around crowdsourcing the curation of licensing, security, accessibility data for FOSS projects. Our first goal is clear licensing data.

Our project is going to do this by harvesting data embedded in projects, curating the data in an open and collaborative process, contributing clearly defined project data back to the FOSS projects, and making the data freely and easily accessible. A virtuous cycle.

To that end, and to hit this first goal, we are looking for data on open source projects with the following information:

* License (declared and observed)
* Copyright holders
* Source location (including revision/commit)

We do, however, understand that not all the data we get about projects will be factual and easily digestible by our tooling, so we are also looking for members of communities and organizations who can help us curate this data. The curation process may be something you or someone in your organization is already doing.
## Let’s talk some more about curation.
The continuing goal of ClearlyDefined is to help originating projects craft and maintain clarity around their in-scope data as a native part of their operation. Here we are looking for help specifically with the curation process. We have also defined who we think a curator to be below.
### Curation process
The curation process is fundamentally open and transparent. Curators (aka project committers or maintainers) work on harvested data, data contributed by the ClearlyDefined community, and with the origin project artifacts and community to validate presented information. All deliberations, discoveries and discussions are recorded and made available for community inspection.
Initially this workflow will happen in one or more GitHub repositories using standard Pull Request workflows on human-readable and diff-able curation artifacts. The project may develop additional tools to supplement or supplant this flow but will always ensure full transparency.
As with committers on typical FOSS projects, curators are free/expected to focus on particular domains that fit their interests and expertise.
### Curator
A data curator is akin to a project maintainer or committer in typical open source projects. Curators have write permissions to the curation repo(s) and are ultimately responsible for admitting data to the curated store. A curator is more librarian and data scientist than lawyer or developer. The role requires enough domain context to enable issue identification and resolution. The role also requires technical expertise in running the various tools used to detect and analyze components. Each curator must be, and be seen to be, vendor neutral and unbiased. This helps them in their other key role – working with upstream projects to incorporate the curated data into the original project.
As with committers and maintainers, curators are nominated and approved by the project community based on their merits and prior contributions. The role of curator relates to an individual, not an organization or a position in an organization. Under no circumstances is a Curator held responsible for any errors or other flaws in the data merged into the service.
### Principles
* Open – The data, infrastructure, and processes are open to all
* Factual – All data is factual. No interpretation or assessment is made
* Upstream – Enable upstream projects as much as possible
* Simple – Wherever possible the project will use the simple solution

Based on these guiding principles, we want to make sure the curation process follows this philosophy.
