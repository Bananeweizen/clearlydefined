We're on a mission to help FOSS projects thrive by being, well,
clearly defined. Lack of clarity around licenses and security
vulnerabilities reduces engagement -- that means fewer users, fewer
contributors and a smaller community. This is a community-wide
challenge and we're taking a community-wide approach. We want to:

* Raise awareness within FOSS project teams
* Make it easy to identify and supply missing information
* Automatically harvest data from projects
* Crowd-source the curation that data
* Feed the curation work back to the original projects

Large-scale FOSS consumers often struggle to fully gather basic things
like the license for a component, the source location (e.g., Git
commit) for a version, details to be included in attributions (e.g,
copyright holders in a Notices file). The net result is that projects
lacking clarity on these points regularly face significant friction in
the FOSS consumers’ internal processes ultimately affecting project
engagement. Everyone loses.
    
To date, most people are paying vendors for tools incurring expenses
to vet FOSS either through repetitive, duplicative efforts or through
employing external services to do this task. ClearlyDefined seeks to
help FOSS projects be more clear from the beginning. It provides a
mechanism for harvesting available data using tools like ScanCode,
Fossology, and others, at scale and facilitates crowd-sourcing the
curation of that information when ambiguities or gaps arise in the
metadata. The ultimate goal of harvesting and curation is to
contribute any new-found clarity (e.g, new licenses found) to the
upstream projects so they can include that info in their next release
-- thus becoming more clearly defined. Everyone wins.

We are currently focused on license, source code location, and
copyright holders, but going forward, we see security, accessibility,
and internationalization all being important parts of the
ClearlyDefined ecosystem. If you are excited about these things, we
encourage you to reach out and get engaged to help us drive those
conversations.

You can participate in the Clearly Defined effort in [several different ways](wiki/Get-Involved).

You can find us at [clearlydefined.io](https://clearlydefined.io), and on
[github.com/clearlydefined](https://github.com/clearlydefined). You can also

want to contribute to ClearlyDefined!
