ClearlyDefined is an incubator project and fiscal sponsoree of the Open Source
Initiative (OSI). The OSI is a US charity (501(c)(3)) with tax ID/EIN is 91-2037395.
Any money intended to support ClearyDefined’s work should be given to the OSI as
a general donation. Those donations can be earmarked for ClearlyDefined and will
be used to support its work.

Payments to the OSI can be made in a few different ways:

### Paypal

The preferred method of donation is via PayPal on OSI’s website at https://opensource.org/donate.
Fill out the form as appropriate and in the **Targeted Donations** section
towards the bottom, put in "ClearlyDefined".

### Network for Good

You can also [donate via Network for Good](https://www.networkforgood.org/donation/MakeDonation.aspx?ORGID2=912037395).
Similar to the PayPal method above, fill out the form as appropriate and put
"ClearlyDefined" in the **Designation** box at the lower left of the form.

### Flattr

[Donating via Flattr](http://flattr.com/thing/448050/Open-Source-Initiative-OSI) is
apparently possible but we are unable to figure out how to do it. If you do figure
out how to donate that way and to target "ClearlyDefined" as the project to support,
please drop us a mail at [clearlydefined@outlook.com](mailto:clearlydefined@outlook.com).

### Check

You can also mail a check to the OSI at the address below. Be sure to write “ClearlyDefined”
in the “notes/memo” field or include a note stating that the donation should be directed
to ClearlyDefined.
