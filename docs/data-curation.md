# Curation and upstreaming

Curating and upstreaming the data is at the heart of the ClearlyDefined effort. It is also one of the
least developed elements of the community. Various team members have years of experience curating
open source for their projects or companies but few have done this collaboratively in an open setting.

The primary challenge for the team right now is figuring out the curation process. Setting up the
guidelines and defining the processes and norms.

If you have been curating data in private and want to start doing that in the open with the ClearlyDefined
community, we want to talk to you. Get in touch on [Discord](https://discord.gg/wEzHJku) or
[the mailing list](mailto:clearlydefined@googlegroups.com).

Help fill this page with lots of great guidance on how to curate free and open source component data.
