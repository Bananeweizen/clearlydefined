There are lots of ways to get involved. We have identified some roles
in the project that might be interesting to you:

## Adopt

If you represent an organization that is interested in getting
involved in this initiative, we are also looking for [project
adopters](Project-adopter). Please
read over the document about project adoption. Project adoption will
likely mean different things to different communities, so please
contact us to discuss it.

## Curate

If you represent an organization that is currently scanning code
internally, you may have people who are serving the role of curator
already. We'd like to see if those people would be interested in
curating data that has been harvested by ClearlyDefined and still
needs some manual curation. We've defined the role of a [data
curator](Data-curator-job-description). We'd
love people like this to join our community.

## Code

If you would be interested in working on the ClearlyDefined software
itself, we have outlined some information about [code
contributors](Code-contributors). Please
also take a look at the
[service](https://github.com/clearlydefined/service),
[crawler](https://github.com/clearlydefined/crawler), and
[website](https://github.com/clearlydefined/website) repos on GitHub
to take a look at the code we're working on.

## Data

As a consumer of FOSS you may have already run internal curations and
figured a bunch of this out. You could donate your findings to the
ClearlyDefined effort.

## Compute

Got cores? You could help by donating compute to run some harvester
Docker images.

## Donate

Donate to ClearlyDefined@OSI and support the above work.

## Consume

If you represent an organization that would be interested in consuming
this data, we have gotten together some
[information](Data-consumer)
for you as well. We'd love to talk with you more about consuming this
data, so if it's interesting to you, please contact us to discuss
this.
