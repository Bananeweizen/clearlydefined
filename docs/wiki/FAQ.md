### [What is this project?](#what-is-this-project)

A FOSS project to crowdsource FOSS metadata so FOSS can be consumed
with confidence and ease to ultimately help make FOSS projects more
successful.

### [What is the governance model of this project?](#what-is-the-governance-model)

This is a FOSS project like any other with the source code licensed
under MIT and all the data licensed under CC0. It is currently housed
as an incubator project under the Open Source Initiative. You can find
the Charter of the organization
[here](Charter). We
adhere to the [Contributor Covenant Code of
Conduct](https://github.com/clearlydefined/clearlydefined/blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).

### [How is this different than other technologies like SPDX, OpenChain, etc.?](#how-is-this-different)

Other technologies like SPDX, OpenChain, Quarter Master, etc. are all
complimentary to ClearlyDefined. This efforts are focused on things
like formats, process, and other technologies; ClearlyDefined is
interested in the data exclusively. We consider these all part of the
same ecosystem but also distinct.

### [I’d like my organization to adopt this technology. What’s involved?](#technology-adoption)

That’s great, we want organizations and foundations in the FOSS
community to adopt this project and participate in this process. We
have more information about project adoption
[here](Project-adopter). What
“clearly defined” means to your organization may mean different
things, so we’d like to talk to you directly about the specifics of
adoption. You can reach out to us to talk more about it.

### [I’d like to participate in the data curation. How do I do that?](#data-curation)

We’ve got a [one-page
description](Data-curator-job-description)
of what a data curator is and what they do that you can read over. In
short, data curators are crucial to the success of this project since
we know a lot of the harvested data will need to be curated to begin
with.

### [I’d like to contribute code or work on the technology.](#code-contribution)

Our GitHub organization is here:
https://github.com/clearlydefined/. There are lots of ways to
contribute code, so we have a [one-page
description](Code-contributors)
for you on this as well. Generally, the project is made up of a
website, a crawler, the metadata service itself, and server-side
work. Depending on your interest and experience, any of those
components can be contributed to. We have individual repos on GitHub
for each of those parts of the project.
